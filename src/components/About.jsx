                <p>Double the delectable scent. Thick cuts of high-quality meat imported from Australia.
                    Burger & Fries signature Â® recipe is grilled over an open flame. With cheese, bacon, and smoked BBQ sauce, it's thick and fluffy. 
                    It is the menu's one-of-a-kindness.
                    Coming soon.</p>
